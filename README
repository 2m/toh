by Martynas Mickeviƒçius 2010

### INFO ###

The program written in JAVA solves the Towers of Hanoi puzzle
using two different algorithms.

When using the recursive algorithm every level of the recursive
function call is shown. This makes it easy to follow along and
to understand how recursive algorithm works.

Iterative solution moves disks around in CW or CCW direction.

Interface is in lithuanian language, but source code and comments
are in english.

### BUILDING AND RUNNING ###

Execute build.bat to build and run.bat to run the program.

You can also execute makejar.bat to archive all the class
files to one jar archive.
